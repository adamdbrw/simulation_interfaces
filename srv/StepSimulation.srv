# Assuming the simulation is paused, simulate a finite number of steps and return to paused state.
# The service only returns once stepping is complete, which might take considerable time.
# There is an alternative in MultiStepSimulation action, which is worth considering for a multi-step interface.

uint64 steps                        # Step through the simulation loop this many times.
